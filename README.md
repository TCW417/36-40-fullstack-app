# 401 JS --  Lab 36 - Async Actions with Signup and Login

Lab 36 implements async Redux middleware functions for use with superagent, allowing a user to sign up and log in to, in this case, our mid-term project myGarage.

Lab 37 adds a conneciton to the Profiles model of the backend and lets you create a new profile and edit it. In addition, it stores your authentication token as a server cookie and retrieves it if it exists so that you don't have to log in again until the cookie expires.  You can manually logout, in which case the server cookie is deleted.
